# 🧠 Cursor Rules for DacarsoftFinanceBot Project

rules:
  - All bot messages must be in Spanish with emojis where appropriate.
  - Use English for comments, function names, and docstrings.
  - Store the bot token and Google credentials in environment variables or config.py.
  - Folder structure must be:
      bot/ → Telegram handlers and parsers
      services/ → Google Sheets integration, config, utilities
      domain/ → Models and validators
      main.py → Entry point
  - Avoid hardcoding strings or categories.
  - Use PEP8 naming conventions and async/await style.
  - Keep code modular and educational, as the project will be shared on DacarSoft’s YouTube channel.
  - When generating new code, include a short summary at the top explaining its purpose.
  - Use f-strings for all dynamic text.
  - Always validate parsed data before saving it to Google Sheets.
