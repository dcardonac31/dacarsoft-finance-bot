⚠️ CREDENTIALS FILE REQUIRED ⚠️

You need to create a file named "credentials.json" in this folder.

This file contains your Google Service Account credentials and is required
for the bot to access Google Sheets.

📋 QUICK STEPS:

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create a new project (or select existing)
3. Enable Google Sheets API and Google Drive API
4. Create a Service Account
5. Generate a JSON key for that service account
6. Download the JSON file
7. Rename it to "credentials.json"
8. Place it in this folder (services/)

📖 DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:

See services/README.md for complete setup instructions.

🔒 SECURITY:

- Never commit credentials.json to Git
- Never share the file publicly
- It's already in .gitignore
- Rotate keys periodically
